# deployRocket Project Dossier

This branch is managed by deployRocket. It intentionally stores only this dossier README as machine-readable and human-readable project memory.

Generated application files are committed to the repository default branch after Codex returns a valid file set. If the default branch only has an initial README, code generation has not succeeded yet.

## Project

Name: Untitled project

Repository: https://github.com/natalikrasnov/mood-mirror-closet

Live site: pending GitHub Pages publish

GitHub Pages status: pending

Code branch: main

State branch: deployrocket-state

## Original Prompt

Create a mobile-first web app that works like an interactive mirror.

The main idea:
The camera should feel like a real mirror on the phone screen — fullscreen, clean, and immersive.

When the app opens:

* ask the user how they feel (options + free text)
* then ask where they are going (options + free text)

After that, open a fullscreen front camera.

The camera must behave like a mirror:

* no UI layout around it
* no panels
* no sections
* the user should feel like they are looking at themselves in a mirror

On top of the mirror:

* an outfit is automatically placed on the user based on mood and destination

Interaction:

* swiping left/right changes the full outfit on the user
* each swipe shows a different look
* add a small “try again” button to generate a new outfit

Add a small floating closet button:

* opens a fullscreen gallery of saved looks
* selecting a look applies it instantly

Keep everything minimal and visual.

The entire experience should feel like:
a smart mirror that helps you decide what to wear today.
